Advanced Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers with User management
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -

-nano loop.sh

-#!/bin/bash

-for ((i=0; i<90; i++))
-do
-echo "$i"
-done
-./loop.sh day 1 90

2.Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
-nano backup.sh 
- #!/bin/bash
- #!/bin/bash
- Backup_d="/home/purnima/90daysofdevops/*"
- Backup="/home/purnima/Backupfolder"
- date=$(date +"%d-%b-%Y")
- mkdir $Backup/$date
-cp -r $Backup_d $Backup/$date
- echo "Backup created in $Backup/$date"

3.Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script

-Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.
-The first step in making the crontab script is to issue the crontab-e command. This opens an empty file where you can make the entries that are submitted to the cron script for execution 
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| min hr day/mo mo/yr day/wk       shell command                        |
| 0   2    *     *       1         backup -0 -uf /dev/rmt0.1 /home/plan.|

4.Read about User Management

-User management refers to the process of creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts on a computer system or network.
-User Administration is the process of managing different user accounts and their respective permissions in an operating system

-User account management is one of the many challenges of Linux system administrators. Some of the responsibilities of a system administrator are enabling/disabling user accounts, preserving the home directory, setting user permissions, assigning groups/shells to users, and managing passwords

5.Create 2 users and just display their Usernames

-sudo vim users.txt
-ravi:12345
-sastri:54321
-admin:/home/ravi:/bin/bash
-admin:/homr/sastri:/bin/bash
-cat users.txt
-sudo chmod 777 users.txt
