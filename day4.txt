1.Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

ans-> The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system 
      and generally has complete control over everything in the system.
      The kernel is a core component of an operating system and 
      serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it.
      The kernel enables multiple applications to share hardware resources by providing access 
      to CPU, memory, disk I/O, and networking


2.What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?

ans-> This first line (#!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh) has a name. It is known as ‘she-bang‘(shabang). This derives from the concatenation of the tokens sharp (#) and bang (!). It is also called as sh-bang, hashbang, poundbang or hash-pling. In computing, a she-bang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.


3.Write a Shell Script which prints I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge

ans-> mkdir script
    - cd script
    - echo"I will be a great DevOps Engineer"
    
   -> nano devops_first.sh
   -> #!/bin/bash
   -> echo"I will be a great DevOps Engineer"
   -> conrol x +Y(yes) + tap(to save)
   -> bash devops_first.sh

4.Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

ans-> #!/bin/bash
      echo "I WILL BE A GREAT DEVOPS ENGINEER"
      #echo $BASH
      name="Purnima"
      echo "hello ${name}" 
      
      ->#!/bin/bash

echo "I WILL BE A GREAT DEVOPS ENGINEER"

#echo $BASH

name="Purnima"

echo "hello ${name},please enter your age"

read age

echo "my age is ${age}"

echo "sub:hello,$1"

sleep 2

echo "Me:hey how you doing"

sleep 2

echo "sub: I am doing good,thankyou"

5.Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

     -if [ "$1" = "like" ]
     -then
     - echo "hey please $1 this post"
