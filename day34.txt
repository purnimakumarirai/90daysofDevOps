Day 34 Task: Working with Services in Kubernetes

-What are Services in K8s

-In Kubernetes, Services are objects that provide stable network identities to Pods and 
abstract away the details of Pod IP addresses. Services allow Pods to receive traffic from other Pods, Services, 
and external clients.


Types of Kubernetes services:
There are five types of Services:
ClusterIP (default): Internal clients send requests to a stable internal IP address.
NodePort: Clients send requests to the IP address of a node on one or more nodePort values that are specified by the Service.
LoadBalancer: Clients send requests to the IP address of a network load balancer.
ExternalName: Internal clients use the DNS name of a Service as an alias for an external DNS name.
Headless: You can use a headless service when you want a Pod grouping, but donâ€™t need a stable IP address

Task-1:

-Create a Service for your todo-app Deployment from Day-32
-Create a Service definition for your todo-app Deployment in a YAML file.
-Apply the Service definition to your K8s (minikube) cluster using the kubectl apply -f service.yml -n <namespace-name> command.
-Verify that the Service is working by accessing the todo-app using the Service's IP and Port in your Namespace.


Task-2:

-Create a ClusterIP Service for accessing the todo-app from within the cluster
-Create a ClusterIP Service definition for your todo-app Deployment in a YAML file.
-Apply the ClusterIP Service definition to your K8s (minikube) cluster using the kubectl apply -f cluster-ip-service.yml -n <namespace-name> command.
-Verify that the ClusterIP Service is working by accessing the todo-app from another Pod in the cluster in your Namespace.


Task-3:

-Create a LoadBalancer Service for accessing the todo-app from outside the cluster
-Create a LoadBalancer Service definition for your todo-app Deployment in a YAML file.
-Apply the LoadBalancer Service definition to your K8s (minikube) cluster using the kubectl apply -f load-balancer-service.yml -n <namespace-name> command.
-Verify that the LoadBalancer Service is working by accessing the todo-app from outside the cluster in your Namespace.
